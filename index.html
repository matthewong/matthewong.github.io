                    <p>
                        I am a grade 12 student at Dr. Norman Bethune C.I. I fell in love with programming
                        the first time I played Super Mario Bros on my friends NES. I knew at that point
                        that I wanted to make a game that people would never stop playing. I'm not a avid
                        gamer myself but I love watching people play. IF they're into it, I'll probably be 
                        just as into it. 
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        As I got older, I started to realize that computers are more than just tools for games.
                        Computers can do anything. As long as you can think it, there is probably a way to tell
                        the computer how to get it done. Now when the internet became relevant to me, it blew my
                        mind how connecting with someone half way accross the world could be done in less than a
                        minute. At that point I knew that programming is what I want to do after school. 
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        Besides programming, another interest that took hold of me late (Grade 12) is finance. I've
                        always avoided Deca but I knew I had to try it in grade 12. Joining Deca in grade 12 helped
                        me realize my interest in finance. The programming applications for financial products and 
                        such are endless. My goal is to pursue computer science and finance in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also keep myself busy with other hobbies too. When I'm not programming or studying, I enjoy
                        morning runs, practicing bassoon/saxophone and watching movies. 
                    </p>

                                    What started as another computer science assigment quickly grew to a full blown
                                    recreation of one of my favorite atari games. This Python version of Atari's Centipede 
                                    is a single player shoot'em up style arcade game where you are trying to last as long
                                    as you can. The bugs get progressively faster as you kill them and a kill streak of 10
                                    will get you an extra life.

                                <p>      
                                    This project is far from over as every so often, someone asks me why my game doesn't
                                    have ____ or I myself might come up with a good idea for the next version of the game. In
                                    addition to pyCentipede, In the future, I do plan on making more games primarily android 
                                    and iOS based.

                                    I started this project December 2015 with one goal in mind. I wanted to begin my
                                    online portfolio so that I could have a place to put all my previous and future 
                                    projects for display. The second best thing about doing all these projects are for
                                    people to see them so might as well do a good job at displaying them. But I did not
                                    realize how much I was going to learn about web development because up until that
                                    point, I just assumed that HTML5 and CSS would just be another walk in the park. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I've learned a lot from the time spent building my online portfolio. In addition to
                                    web development skills, I've learned that you can't build a website like you're 
                                    drawing a smiley face on paper. Building a website requires lots of planning prior to
                                    the actual coding. After you've drawn out the different parts, you have to figure out 
                                    how you can code it in the most efficient way. The big difference with HTML5/CSS and 
                                    any other programming language is the interactivity with all the different languages
                                    in web development. I've never had to think about the most efficient way to lay out
                                    and organize the web page.      
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I know there are many opportunities with web development and in the future I plan on 
                                    improving what I know. I know this will be a very useful skill not just in university
                                    but also in the work force.
